# This is a bot I created as a recreational project to compete in an AI competition. 
# The bot plays warzone games against other bots. Warzone games are similar to the RISK board game in that players start with territories on a map with the objective of conquering the rest of the map and eliminating other players.
# The bot communicates with the competition's game generator via parsable String input and output. An example game transcript can be found in the SampleGame.txt file which shows the game generator setting up the game and map, the moves the bots send the generator in each round, and the generator updating the game state due to the moves.
